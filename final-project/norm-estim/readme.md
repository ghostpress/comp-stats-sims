## Schatten 2*p*-norm Estimation

The code and proofs for this topic follow sections 4.8 through 5.2 and 5.4 of Martinsson & Tropp (2021). The files are as follows:

* norm_simulation.Rmd : the full code file in R notebook format for the simulation that explores these methods
* norm_estimation_proofs.pdf : proofs of correctness for the methods, as well as a brief discussion of their context and limitations

To recreate the simulation on your local machine, clone this repository and run the notebook file in RStudio. The "Set Up" chunk contains the libraries needed to run this code - use `install.packages()` in the console to download them before running.
