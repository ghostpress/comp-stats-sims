## Final Project

Here lives the material for my final project, which explores the Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra methods outlined in Martinsson & Tropp (2021). Find the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01387v1). For this project I focus on the following topics:

* Trace estimation by sampling (sections 4.1 through 4.2)
* Schatten p-norm estimation by sampling (sections 4.8 through 5.2 and 5.4)
* Maximum eigenvalues and trace functions

Each topic has its own sub-directory in this repo, each with its own readme, code, and a pdf file with proofs of the theory. There you will also find instructions for how to run the simulations and reproduce the results. All proofs and code are my own.
